/*  Problem Statement : Knightâ€™s tour: The problem is to move the knight, beginning from any given square on the 
                        chessboard, in such a manner that it travels successively to all 64 squares, touching each
                        square once and only once. It is convenient to represent a solution by placing the numbers
                        1,2, ...,64 in the squares of the chessboard indicating the order in which the squares are 
                        reached. Note that it is not required that the knight be able to reach the initial position 
                        by one more move; if this is possible the knight's tour is called re-entrant. One of the more 
                        ingenious methods for solving the problem of the knight's tour is that given by J. C. Warnsdorff
                        in 1823. His rule is that the knight must always be moved to one of the squares from which there
                        are the fewest exits to squares not already traversed. Write a C++ program to implement Warnsdorff's
                        rule and show it graphically.
